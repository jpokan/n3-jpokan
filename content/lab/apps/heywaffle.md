HeyWaffle.app is a webapp made in collaboration with Daniel Chung. A digital tool that can help people organize their daily lives in a more visual and interactive way. Designed around the idea of an intuitive board system, where users can manage tasks, plans, notes, and personal goals through a collection of flexible widgets.

Working on HeyWaffle allowed me to focus on building an engaging user experience centered on simplicity, customization, and interaction. I implemented a dynamic interface where users can arrange different widgets on a board to create their own personalized organization space. This project pushed me to think carefully about usability, layout structure, and how to make productivity tools feel natural rather than overwhelming.

Through the development process, I strengthened my skills in frontend architecture, interactive UI design, and building modular components that can scale as the platform grows. HeyWaffle reflects my interest in creating digital products that combine thoughtful design with practical functionality, and it gave me valuable experience in developing user-centered applications that support everyday life management.
