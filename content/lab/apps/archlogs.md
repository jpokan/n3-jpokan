ArchLogs.com is a personal web project to explore the idea of creating a digital archive for architectural work — a platform where architects and designers can upload, organize, and showcase conceptual or unbuilt projects. The goal was to combine portfolio presentation with an accessible system for storing architecture files and project documentation in a structured way.

While developing ArchLogs, I worked on the full process of building a modern web application, from designing the user experience to implementing the backend infrastructure. I built the frontend using Nuxt, focusing on creating a fast, responsive interface and a clean navigation flow for managing uploaded projects. On the backend side, I integrated Appwrite to handle authentication, file storage, and database management, which gave me practical experience working with scalable backend services and user-driven content platforms.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in full-stack development, learned how to connect frontend applications with real storage and database systems, and gained a deeper understanding of building tools tailored to creative professionals. ArchLogs reflects my interest in the intersection of architecture, design, and web technology, and my ability to develop functional platforms from concept to implementation.
